# Ack plugin for Vico

This plugin uses [Ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) to recursively search
the project directory.

Vico version 1.3 is required for this plugin to work.

## Key bindings

### In normal mode:

&#x21E7;&#x2318;F -- Bring up the ack window, same as `:ack`.

### In the file explorer:

&#x21E7;&#x2318;F -- Bring up the ack window with the selected folder as base search folder.

### In the result list:

- `<cr>` -- go to the selected result
- `o` -- go to the selected result in the current view
- `s` -- go to the selected result in a split view
- `v` -- go to the selected result in a vertical split view
- `t` -- go to the selected result in a new tab
- `<esc>` -- cancel a running search
- `/` -- focus the filter field

Additionally, most vi motion commands are available to navigate the result list.
